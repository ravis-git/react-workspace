Workspace for the other react project


## CSS Pre-Processing
React CLI natively (create-react-app does not support css preprocessing).
The documented way of doing this is to eject the project from CLI and go it on your own.

*In this project, added a gulp task that watches all the scss files and re-compiles them on change. There may be a more efficient way to do this, but it does the trick.*

check package.json and gulpfile to see how it works
